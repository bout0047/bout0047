    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    <p class="robot1">Science I was little I always was fascinated by all kinds of technologies. I started to realize that technology is more important in our live than we think. It helps us to deal with daily dynamic things, which we take for granted. It improves efficiency amongst many big companies and even in your own home. And it gives everyone the access to very much information in the palm of their hands.
      
      </p>
      <p class="robot1">I want to study IT because I want to solve all kinds of problems and I think that this course is the best way to do that. Also, a Software product is infinitely scalable to the point that everyone on the planet uses your app.I like the fact that programming involves endless learning.</p>
